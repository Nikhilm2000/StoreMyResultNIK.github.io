	Engineering Students Nowadays do not have the habit of remembering their marks of the previous semester or the work rating of the last project in the company, this can actually cause a huge problem to students in their final year of Engg/if switching companies is taking place, in order to solve this, we here at storemyresults.com would love to provide a platform to students/Graduates to store their results of the previous/current semester thereby making it comfortable to access results and marks accessible whenever required, fun fact, Majority of students don’t even remember the marks of their current semester and the sophisticated design of result websites make it a little difficult to access the same.
The most important part of making this site is the user experience, which results in specific university websites do not focus on design as functionality outweighs design in these specific websites, which can further ruin the user experience, here the focus 
lies on functionality and design. 
The Working Process is pretty simple here we ask students to create an account with us and we tend to store the data that they enter, the data might include USN, NAME and SUBJECT NAMES with their finalized marks, once that is done we keep a submit option wherein the users/Students can submit their responses.
The content of the web page at the time of submission should be downloadable in pdf form for their reference, the data of the user should be completely secured and (s)he has to make an account and set their password to access their account at any point in time. This will make it easier for the students to retrieve their results or marks of any subject of any semester anytime.
